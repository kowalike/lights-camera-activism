# Week 10 to 14 - Project Greenlight

Class does not meet these weeks, however, the instructor is available to meet during class time if students would like to discuss their projects. 

Students are required to submit weekly Project Check-Ins which that serve as a check-in for how the projects are going and what, if any, issues they are facing.

During Week 14 a rough cut of the final project is turned in to allow for instructor feedback before the final screening during Week 15.

Did anything surprising or unexpected happen during the shot? 
- What questions and concerns arose this week about the final project? What ways will you and your team work to solve them? Be as specific as possible, for example you may not be able to get a piece of footage you need; you can’t get a hold of person you need to interview, etc.
