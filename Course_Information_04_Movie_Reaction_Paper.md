# Movie Reaction Paper

Stephen King once said, “If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.” 

The same is true for movies. The purpose of having you view these films is so you can increase your exposure to the techniques of other documentary makers and hopefully glean some useful insights for your final project.

## What am I doing?

By Week 9 you will view 1 movie from the list below and turn in a paper analyzing the film and its effectiveness. It is recommended you review the Looking at Movies Film Analysis video in the course site for a brief overview of how one can analyze a film.

Titles with an * at the end can be be viewed online, all of them are on 4-hour reserve in the Raynor Memorial Libraries. 

Each movie reaction paper must be no less than one page single-spaced, 12-point Arial font, and no more than two pages single-spaced. I will enforce the page limit and will not read past the second page. 

The paper should be in two sections (see below) and turned in to the appropriate course dropbox by the due date on the course calendar. 

### SECTION 1: FILM ANALYSIS

Address the following prompts, don’t just list the prompt and write a response, use transitions to link the questions together:

- What is the principal subject of this documentary? What is its principal purpose? Does it argue for a position? Does it critique a position? What kind of impact does it seek to achieve with - and upon - its intended audience?
- Does this movie use footage for symbolic or metaphorical purposes on top of, in addition to, or in preference versus the literal information available from the image? If so, how, and to what particular kind of (intended) effect?
- What kinds of witnesses, experts, and/or other participants does the movie use, how are they used to get the movie's chief points across? Were these individuals effective? Why or why not?
- What particular degrees and variations of focus, shot types, exposure, sharpness, brightness, contrast, color and/or hue are used and how effective are these cinematographic means to getting the movie’s chief points across?

### SECTION 2: MOVIE’S EFFECTIVENESS

- How would you evaluate the effectiveness of this movie? Did it challenge you to rethink or change your view of this or a related topic? If so, what was so compelling? If not, why do you think the movie did not make you change your mind, i.e. lack of strong evidence, overly dramatized cinematography, not providing both sides equal representation, etc.
