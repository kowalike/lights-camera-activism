# Week 5b - Copyright Confusion in the Digital Age

Students should come to class with the project topic they want to focus their final project on. 

For the 2 credit pass/fail course, the copyright discussion is incorporated into the Movie Trailer Remix class later in the course.  

## Learning Objectives

- Describe why copyright law exists and its history.
- Identify Creative Commons licenses.
- Discuss the unique challenges of copyright and intellectual property in the digital age.

## Resources

Core readings were used for the 2 credit pass/fail course and the 3 credit graded course used both Core and Additional resources.

### Core

## Discussion

The first 15 to 20 minutes of class are dedicated to discussion of the weekly resources. If you assign a weekly reaction paper, you can also pull questions students ask in those papers. 

- What is Creative Commons, how does it work, and is it an effective way to mediate between the rights of the artist and the creativity of the samplers?
- Should sampling be treated differently from covering a song in terms of copyright law and clearance? Why or why not? If so, how?
- What, if any, are the exceptions for when “copying” is acceptable?
- Grey Tuesday was an event in which websites hosted free downloads of The Grey Album and turned their pages grey as a symbolic demonstration to fight what organizers called EMI's "corporate censorship" — denying the public the chance to hear a work they felt had great artistic merit. Do you agree with this behavior, was EMI practicing corporate censorship or protecting their ownership and copyrights. 
- What are moral rights? Do you believe they should play a role in American copyright laws?
- What is the idea-expression dichotomy? How could this be used to counter point those who support remixing? 
- Dames argues that remix rebels should spend less time complaining about how bad the law is and defiantly breaking it and instead spend their time working to changes the laws that relate to copyright. Do you agree with his argument?
- What is your opinion of the Cariou decision? Should aesthetic judgment be applied when determining whether artwork infringes on copyright or is protected under fair use?   
- There are many examples of artistic appropriation, from literature to journalism to music. Do you agree that many artists borrow as a fundamental part of the artistic/creative process? Should artists have the freedom to do so?
- Is there a distinction between borrowing that is derivative versus borrowing that is transformative. Is one wrong and the other right? How can we tell the difference and who ultimately determines that?
- What other examples of artistic appropriation can you think of?
- How would you feel if someone else sampled your song? Does money affect the way you feel about it? Does it make a difference if the person who sampled your song is making money from his/her music? Does it make a difference if you are being compensated financially for it? What would you want someone sampling to do in return?
- You have been asked to make your final project available in Marquette’s Institutional Repository where it will be freely accessible in perpetuity. How does this make you feel? Do you think this is a good idea? Would you consider not putting it in the repository? If not why not?

## In Class Activity

### Another Perspective - The Fashion Industry 
(*adapted from PBS Copyright Criminals film educator guide*)

Unlike the music industry, the fashion industry has flourished without copyright protection on designs. 

Through fashion we have a ringside seat on the ecology of creativity in a world of networked communication. Ideas arise, evolve through collaboration, gain currency through exposure, mutate in new directions, and diffuse through imitation. The constant borrowing, repurposing, and transformation of prior work are as integral to creativity in music and film as they are to fashion.

Divide the class into four groups and explain that each group will read and discuss different (but related) articles and then report back to the class. Distribute [the following article to each group](https://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0909/p09s01-coop.html) along with one of the following:

- [The Fashion Industry’s Piracy Paradox - from PublicKnowledge.org](https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/fashion-industrys-piracy-paradox)
- [Flattery Gets You Everywhere - from Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/d8fa7b7c-93f9-11dc-acd0-0000779fd2ac) 
- [Why That Hoodie Your Son Wears Isn’t Trademarked - from The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/business/05scene.html) 
- [Put A Patent on That Pleat from BusinessWeek](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-03-19/put-a-patent-on-that-pleat)

As a group, read, take notes, and discuss the following guide questions. Then choose a spokesperson to report to the class. 

- Why has the fashion industry been commercially viable even sans copyright protection for designers?
- How does borrowing and copying help the creative process in fashion design?
- What might happen if laws such the as the Design Piracy Prohibition Act were to be passed? The bill would amend Title 17 of the United States Code to provide protection to fashion designs for a period of three years. The Acts would have extend protection to "the appearance as a whole of an article of apparel, including its ornamentation," with "apparel" defined to include "men's, women's, or children's clothing, including undergarments, outerwear, gloves, footwear, and sheadgear;" "handbags, purses, and tote bags;" belts, and eyeglass frames.

After discussing the three questions above, pose the following question to the entire class:

- Could the fashion industry’s model be viable for the music industry, in terms of the sampling and borrowing of sounds and musical ideas?
