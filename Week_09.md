# Week 9 - Non Narrative Video

Students implement the production plan and script they crafted in the previous class to create a 1 minute video that tells a story where there is no dialogue or narration-only the camera, movement, and a musical soundtrack, to tell the story.  

The Final Movie Production Plan document is also due this day. 

This is the last class meeting until the week before finals. The class will not meet as students work on their final project, but the instructor is available to meet during class time if students need assistance or want to discuss their project progress. 

## Learning Objectives
