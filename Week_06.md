# Week 6 - Creating Motion Graphics

Week 6 begins the hands on lab portion of the course. The students meet in Marquette's Digital Scholarship Lab and spent the class time working on various editing assignments. 

During this class students are introduced to creating motion graphics and kinetic typography using Microsoft PowerPoint. These techniques can be used to add some pop into their final project video. 

In preparation for the class, students should bring a brief piece of text they would like to use kinetic typography on and/or an idea for a motion graphic. 
  

## Learning Objectives

- Create motion graphics.
- Create kinetic typography.

## Resources

In addition to these resources, I usually create a PowerPoint file showing how to do both the motion graphics and kinetic typography and walk the students through the process. Students can also download the file and reverse engineer it.

## In Class Activity

### Motion Graphics Assignment 

For this assignment, you will use PowerPoint to create a motion graphic and kinetic typography. 

PowerPoint lacks the bells and whistles of a more advanced program like Adobe After Effects, but its easy to use and can create engaging motion graphics that can be incorporated into your final project videos. 

Tutorial videos and example PowerPoint files can be found in the  course site.

Before coming to class think about what kind of motion graphic you want to create and what piece of text you want to utilize for kinetic typography. 

This is meant as an introductory exercise, so think of a short piece that could be realistically completed in the duration of class and tells a story.

Some food for thought, a timeline, highlighting different portions of a chart or graph, lines from a song or speech.  

#### How to Turn in This Assignment

During class time you will create the following:

1.	At least a 30 second to 1 minute in length motion graphic. 
2.	At least 30 second piece of kinetic typography

Once you have completed your two pieces, export them as a video from PowerPoint by following these steps:

1.	Click **File**
2.	Click **Export**
3.	Click **Create a Video** from the on screen options
4.	Under the Create Video heading, select **Standard (480p)** from the first drop down menu
5.	In the second drop down menu select **Use Recorded Timings and Narrations**
6.	Click **Create Video**
7.	In the window that appears, locate your Desktop and save the file there
8.	Once the file has been created, upload it to the appropriate course dropbox. 

If there is time permitting, we will screen and constructively critique the projects.
