# Reading Reaction Paper

There are 3 reasons why I am asking you to do this assignment. 

I am honestly interested in your analysis and opinions of the material. Have a mindset that you are composing for an audience instead of performing for a verdict. If you don’t like a particular piece of material, that is okay, just give a well-reasoned explanation why, not just “this reading is boring.” Even though we have a small class, not everyone may have an opportunity to or feel comfortable speaking about the readings during class. Your writing and my feedback on it provide another opportunity for us to engage in dialogue regarding the material.

Secondly, this assignment provides an opportunity to practice your critical writing skills and understanding and evaluating multiple texts. 

Finally, I want to get a sense of what questions and issues the class encounters while doing the readings. 
 
## What am I doing?

For weeks 2 through 6 you will be required to write a reaction paper about the readings for that week (**NOTE:** Readings is an inclusive term for all items in the Resources section for that week, i.e. videos, articles, book chapters, etc.). 

Each paper must be no less than one page single-spaced, 12-point Arial font, and no more than two pages single-spaced. I will enforce the page limit and will not read past the second page. 

Tell me what you think about the reading(s) for the week. **NOTE:** You need not address all the readings, for example you may find that only 1 or 2 of the resources are particularly surprising, relatable to your own experience, etc.  

The questions below can help guide your paper – please do not summarize the material, just dive right in: 
- Address what struck you as surprising, inconsistent, difficult, troubling in the readings and why? 
- How do the readings relate to something in your own experience? 
- Did some moment or passage in the text seem to be particularly significant? Why? 
- What important questions regarding this topic(s) remain unanswered for you?

## How to Turn in this Assignment
