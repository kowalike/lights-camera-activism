## Course Description:

Welcome to HOPR 2953. This semester, we will embark on a shared inquiry into social justice and documentary activism. Our main questions are not just academic: they matter both in and beyond school contexts. Specifically, we will be asking: What is social justice? How can one leverage new media tools to enact social change? What can I do to create a more just, verdant and peaceful world?

- In **Unit 1 (weeks 1-5)** we will establish a foundation to build on for the remainder of the course by defining and explaining the terms social justice, story and documentary activism. We will examine various examples of social justice activities and documentaries to provide context as you begin to decide what social justice issue you would like to highlight for with the lens.
- In **Unit 2 (weeks 6-9)**, you will be exposed to the tools and techniques of digital storytelling and create a few short videos offering you a low stakes hands on experience with the digital storytelling process.
- **Unit 3 (weeks 10-14)** belongs to you: it is your time to complete a self-designed video project on a social justice issue.  

## Course Objectives:

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** At the end of the course, students may vary in their ability to achieve the objectives listed below.  In addition, you are likely to achieve these objectives only if you attend class regularly, complete all assignments to the best of your ability, participate actively in class activities and group work, and prepare diligently for class.

- Define what is social justice and identify it in the “real world.”
- Differentiate between justice and charity.
- Examine and evaluate various examples and approaches to documentary activism.
- Develop basic proficiency in the use of multimedia technologies and digital storytelling techniques.
- Create a video, based on primary and secondary sources, highlighting a social justice issue.

## Course Materials:

You probably noticed there are no books for this course. Instead, we will work with a range of online texts, including scholarly publications, e-books and videos. There will also be a few items on course reserve in the Marquette Raynor Memorial Libraries. Please not only read but also take notes and take time to reflect on the readings.

## Course Assignments:

- **Participation (10%)**
	- The first half of this course (through Week 5) will be structured as a seminar, this means there will be NO lectures. Instead there will be class discussions and in class activities. You will earn points for each session in which you participate in the discussion and activity. You cannot make up participation points if you are absent. During Unit 3, your Project Check-Ins will count as your participation grade for these weeks. 
- **Practice Media Assignments (30%)**
	-  During Week 6 through Week 9, these practice assignments (credit/no credit) invite you to get familiar and playful with the camera, editing software and digital storytelling techniques. 
- **Digital Movie Project (60%)**
	- You will develop, shoot, edit and screen a 3 to 5 minute advocacy movie on a social justice issue from the past or present. In addition to the completed movie, you will also need to include the following items listed below. A collection of articles about potential topics can be found in the Final Project Topic Folder on Reserve for this class. Class time on September 25th has been set aside as a work day so you can complete the Final Project Production Plan documents which includes the following items: 
		- **Annotated Bibliography:**
			- 5 to 7 sources that will provide background information for your topic. Materials can be journal articles, books, newspaper, magazine articles or archival audiovisual materials. NO MORE than 2 items can be original interviews recorded by you.
		- **Production Plan**
			- Complete the Production Plan document where you will spell out the who, what, why, where and how of your project and help guide you through your digital storytelling process. 
		- **Script and Optional Storyboard:**
			- The script is a blueprint for the audiovisual telling of your story. A film script is a linear structure that is made up of many parts: action, characters, music, visual imagery etc. An optional Storyboard may be included too.
		- **Shooting Schedule:**
			- Complete the shooting schedule document that will help you plan when you will be shooting B-Roll, interviews, etc. The schedule you submit does NOT need to be the final schedule, as interview times are always subject to change, but you should have a rough idea of when you plan on doing your shooting.
		- **Interview Release Form(s):**
			- The video must contain at least ONE interview. Anyone interviewed in your final film will need to have signed a media release form. This will allow the film to be posted to Marquette’s Institutional Repository and wherever else you may wish to post it, i.e. YouTube, Facebook, etc.
