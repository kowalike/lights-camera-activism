# Week 5a - Final Project Production Plan Workday

Students should come to class with the project topic they want to focus their final project on. For the 2 credit pass/fail course this project workday allows students an opportunity to make progress or complete the final project production plan.

Before students begin their work, the crop dusting scene from North by Northwest is shown. This allows students to see how the storyboard and script translated into a completed scene and how much work it took. 

Students appreciated having a day to work on the final project production plan and ask questions. One could consider tweaking the 3 credit graded course schedule to add this workday in.

## Learning Objectives
