# Week 7 - Marquette Minute Video

During this class students are introduced to the camera and audio equipment in Marquette's Digital Scholarship lab and complete an in class editing assignment using iMovie.

Students get a brief tutorial on how to use iMovie by either the instructor or a lab tutor. 

The footage for the in class editing assignment was created by tutors in the lab and is pre-loaded on all of the lab computers. By having this stock footage, students already have material to work with and focus on getting used to iMovie and basic editing. 

Students are required to view the tutorial videos listed in the Resources before coming to class. Students are also encouraged to refer back to the tutorials as they work on their final project.
