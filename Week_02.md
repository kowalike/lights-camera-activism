# Week 2 - Social Justice and Abelism

After class discussion, students do a brief report out about what they discovered during their building accessibility audit. 

Then the class watches [When Billy Broke His Head ...and Other Tales of Wonder](https://kartemquin.com/products/ktq0143/when-billy-broke-his-head-dvd) an entertaining, irreverent road movie about disability, civil rights, and the search for intelligent life after brain damage. *Streaming rights for the film can also be purchased through Kartemquin Films*.

Viewing the movie offers students an opportunity to analyze the use of video to create awareness of a social justice issue as well as learn about accessibility barriers that exist for persons with disabilities.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify social justice activities.
- Compare and contrast the difference between charity and social justice.
- Define ableism.
- Identify examples of ableism.

## Homework

Students usually have fun with The 99 Ways to Tell a Story Assignment and it helps to get them thinking about how stories can be told from different perspectives and angles. If you can only give one homework assignment, 99 Ways to Tell a Story would be the suggested one. 

From Print to Screen is a good exercise in helping students unpack print media stories and figuring out ways to make that into a story that could be filmed. 

### 99 Ways to Tell A Story

The purpose of this assignment is to explore the mechanics of storytelling and how genre, point of view, visual style, pacing, framing, and so on can effect a story even when multiple storytellers use the same source material.

This is not an artistic exercise!! Feel free to use whatever means you are most comfortable with to visualize the story; i.e. photos, stick figures, hand drawn images, etc.

Before beginning this assignment please read the introduction of [Matt Madden's book 99 Ways to Tell a Story](http://mattmadden.com/comics/99x/discover-99-ways-to-tell-a-story-exercises-in-style/) (it is available at class reserve in the library) and review some of the variations of his initial story template.

> **Note:** The assignment instructions are included in a PowerPoint file with an additional three slides with 4 square boxes on the slides similar to how the author lays out his stories. 

Then complete the following 3 slides using the same simple story:

1. Mom puts food on table, calling child to come eat dinner.
2. A cat climbs up on the table.
3. The cat eats up all the food.
4. The child enters to find the dinner gone, looks disappointed.

**Slide 1:** Create a straight forward telling of the story similar to Madden's template story.

**Slide 2:** Complete the story using a certain genre, i.e. super hero, war, etc. Again reference Madden for examples of other genres.

**Slide 3:** Complete the story from a different Point of View (POV). For example what would the story look like from the Mom's, cat's, child or table's perspective. Again reference Madden's examples where he tells his story from a different POV. 

Turn in your slides by the due date listed in the course calendar and be prepared to showcase your slides during our next class meeting.

### From Print to Screen

(*Adapted from Video for Change, by Gregory et al., page 82*)

This assignment challenges you to think about what are the key elements and people in a story, and consider how these would translate if you were to document the story using video.

Start by selecting a recent newspaper/magazine article, editorial or short video news piece that relates to the central theme of an advocacy issue you are interested in. 

Next, complete the activities and answer the questions below. Turn in a  copy of the article, or a link to its web version as well as the answers to the questions below to the appropriate D2L Dropbox by the date indicated on the course calendar.  

- Highlight the key sentences that explain the story. What are the key elements of this story? Often you will find that in a newspaper article the title and first three paragraphs gives a synopsis of the story, and then the first sentence of each paragraph following and the final paragraph fill it out and summarize the article. If you use an editorial you will also see the point of view, argument and conclusion of the writers.
- Go through the article and highlight the names of the people featured-these are your potential characters. 
- Go through the article and highlight in a different color the key images that are described-these could be activities, locations, or inanimate objects. 
- Think through some of the challenges you will face in taking this story from print to screen, such as:
	- Where is the story taking place? Is this somewhere you can film or would you need to find other ways to show/tell the story without going to this place?
	- Who are the people in the article? Are they people you could film?
	- How could you film the images you’ve identified? If they are inaccessible, what are your alternatives?
	- How much is taking place in the present day? How much in the past? How will this affect the way you tell the story?
	- What might you be able to express through writing that would be difficult to show in a movie? And vice-versa?
	- Does the story have a beginning, middle and end? Is it self-contained or open ended?
	- If it is an editorial, what is the argument of the editorial-what is it asking for or arguing for? How could you express this in video?
	- How would you find a way to tell this story if you had no money? No ability to interview anyone?
	- Choose one potential interviewee from the story, and draft 3 questions you would ask them if you were to interview them for a documentary movie.
