# Week 8 - Movie Trailer Remix

This class provides another opportunity for students to practice using iMovie for editing and to implement some movie making techniques they have learned about.

If you decided to do use Week 5b, the beginning of the class can be used to provide brief refresher on copyright and Fair Use.    

## Learning Objectives

- Create your own remix.
- Explain the idea of remix as an analytic framework found and applicable across a wide variety of context.
- Develop familiarity with multimedia editing software.

## In Class Activity

### Fair Use or Copyright Infringement

Break the class into groups and share the following scenario with them. In addition to the scenario, [share a side by side photo of one of the contested photos](https://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2013/april/26/richard-prince-wins-next-round-of-copyright-battle/).

*Photographer Patrick Cariou published in 2000 Yes, Rasta a book of photographs of the rastafarian community in Jamaica. Richard Prince in 2008 created Canal Zone, a series of art works incorporating Cariou's photographs. Prince's works involved copying the original photographs and engaging in a variety of transformations. These included printing them, increasing them in size, blurring or sharpening, adding content (sometimes in color), and sometimes compositing multiple photographs together or with other works. Prince exhibited his collection at Gagosian Gallery in New York as appropriation art.* 

*In 2009, Cariou filed a copyright infringement suit against Richard Prince, as well as Gagosian Gallery, Larry Gagosian (the founder and owner of the gallery), and RCS MediaGroup (which printed the exhibit catalog).
The Southern District of New York (SDNY) said Prince’s work infringed on copyright. On appeal the Second Circuit court reversed the decision saying all but 5 of the works were transformative.* 

Ask the groups to discuss the four factors of Fair Use and how they would apply to this case. Then ask how they would rule in this case and why.

**Fair Use Four Factors**

1.	The purpose and character of your use;
	- Has the material you have taken from the original work been transformed by adding new expression or meaning?
	- Was value added to the original by creating new information, new aesthetics, new insights, and understandings?
2.	The nature of the copyrighted work;
3.	The amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and;
4.	The effect of the use upon the potential market.

Conclude the activity by showing the [brief video on Prince's exhibition of other people's Instagram photos in his gallery exhibition](https://youtu.be/PMjMI5hWDTE) and asking for student's thoughts on having their social media photos appropriated by someone else.   

### Non Narrative Video Assignment Preparation

Students will spend the next class shooting and editing a non narrative video. In preparation for that, 20 minutes is set aside for them to come up with a story board and scout locations in the library so they can be prepared to film their work during the next class. [An example of a non narrative video is shown](https://youtu.be/eB8xG7WtxMA). 

This can be a group or individual assignment. 

### Movie Trailer Remix Assignment

(*Adapted from Ben McCorkle @ Ohio State University*)  

For this assignment, you will use iMovie to create a remix of a movie trailer that disrupts, complicates, or otherwise challenges the underlying ideology of the original. 

Convert a romantic comedy into something that highlights its creepy stalker factor; foreground the slapstick nature of the run-of-the-mill slasher film; update a classic for today. Review the examples at “[Top Ten Movie Trailer Recuts](https://www.toptenz.net/top-10-movie-trailer-recuts-remixes.php)” for inspiration.  

Although you may incorporate some original content in the composition, keep in mind that this is primarily an exercise in rearranging, combining, and transforming pre-existing material. 

#### Assignment Prep Work

Locate one original movie trailer on YouTube. Think about how you want to remix it, i.e. change the music to turn a thriller into a comedy, rearrange footage, add a new voice over turning a mystery into a romantic comedy. 

- Download a copy of the original trailer. You can use a website such as [KeepVid](https://keepvid.com/) to get an .MP4 version of a YouTube video. 
- Find audio from Soundzabound that you will use in your re-mix. 
- Consider creating a storyboard. This does not need to be in a physical form, you can have the storyboard in your head. However it will make the process easier if you have a physical version to reference. 

#### How to Turn in this Assignment

Once you have completed the video, export it from iMovie in Medium size format (640x360) and upload the file to the appropriate Dropbox. 

In addition to the video, include a brief write up that addresses the following prompts: 

- What is the purpose of your remix? Is it a critique or parody? 
- How and to what degree did the remix transform the original content?
- Does your remix feel sufficiently like a new piece? Use your understanding of Fair Use and copyright to explain why or why not.

If there is time permitting, we will screen and constructively critique the remixes.
